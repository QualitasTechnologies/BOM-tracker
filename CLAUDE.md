## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### Code Standards
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Use shadcn-ui components consistently
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for async operations

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests for Firebase operations
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Performance testing for large data operations

### CEO Dashboard Specific Requirements
- **Data Model First**: Implement complete data models before UI
- **Mandatory Delay Logging**: Cannot save milestone date changes without reason + attribution
- **Real-time Calculations**: All KPIs must calculate in real-time from source data
- **Exception-Based Design**: Surface problems automatically, don't make CEO hunt
- **Historical Transparency**: Never delete delay history, maintain complete audit trail
- **Client-Shareable**: Delay history must be presentable to clients

### Deployment Process
1. Test locally with Firebase emulators
2. Deploy Firebase Functions for backend services
3. Test n8n workflow integrations
4. Deploy to production via Lovable platform

## üìã CEO DASHBOARD DATA REQUIREMENTS

### New Firebase Collections Needed

**1. Milestones Collection**
```typescript
interface Milestone {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  // Planning dates (never change after initial planning)
  originalPlannedStartDate: Date;
  originalPlannedEndDate: Date;
  originalEstimatedDuration: number; // calendar days
  // Current dates (updated when delayed)
  currentPlannedStartDate: Date;
  currentPlannedEndDate: Date;
  // Actual dates
  actualStartDate?: Date;
  actualEndDate?: Date;
  // Status
  status: 'Not Started' | 'In Progress' | 'Completed' | 'Blocked';
  completionPercentage: number;
  // Metadata
  createdAt: Date;
  createdBy: string;
}
```

**2. Delay Logs Collection** (Critical)
```typescript
interface DelayLog {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  milestoneId?: string;
  // What changed
  changeType: 'milestone' | 'project';
  itemName: string;
  originalDate: Date;
  newDate: Date;
  delayDays: number;
  // Why it changed (required fields)
  reason: string; // min 20 chars
  attribution: 'Internal-Team' | 'Internal-Process' | 'External-Client' | 'External-Vendor' | 'External-Other';
  supportingNotes?: string;
  // Impact
  cumulativeProjectDelay: number; // total days project delayed
  // Metadata
  loggedAt: Date;
  loggedBy: string;
}
```

**3. Check-ins Collection**
```typescript
interface CheckIn {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  projectId: string;
  milestoneId?: string;
  taskId?: string;
  // Time tracking
  timestamp: Date;
  hoursSpent: number;
  // Progress
  whatAccomplished: string;
  updatedCompletionPercentage?: number;
  // Blockers
  blockerDescription?: string;
  blockerCategory?: 'Internal-Team' | 'Internal-Process' | 'External-Client' | 'External-Vendor';
}
```

**4. Project Updates** (extend existing Project model)
```typescript
interface Project {
  // ... existing fields ...
  // New fields for CEO Dashboard
  category: 'Internal' | 'Customer';
  kickoffDate: Date;
  originalTargetEndDate: Date; // never changes
  currentTargetEndDate: Date; // updates when delayed
  budgetedAmount: number;
  // Calculated fields (computed in real-time)
  totalSpent?: number; // sum of hours * hourly rates
  budgetPercentConsumed?: number;
  timelinePercentConsumed?: number;
  progressPercentage?: number;
  cumulativeDelayDays?: number;
}
```

**5. CEO Notes Collection**
```typescript
interface CeoNote {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  noteText: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  createdBy: string; // CEO user ID
  visibleToProjectOwner: boolean;
}
```

**6. Blockers Collection** (for repeated blocker tracking)
```typescript
interface Blocker {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  milestoneId?: string;
  taskId?: string;
  description: string;
  category: 'Internal-Team' | 'Internal-Process' | 'External-Client' | 'External-Vendor';
  firstReportedDate: Date;
  reportCount: number;
  lastReportedDate: Date;
  resolved: boolean;
  resolvedDate?: Date;
  resolutionNote?: string;
}
```

### KPI Calculation Logic

**Budget Burn Rate**
- Daily burn rate = Total spent / Days elapsed
- Projected days until budget exhausted = Budget remaining / Daily burn rate
- Status: Compare projected days to days remaining in timeline

**Timeline Alignment**
- Timeline % = Days elapsed / Total project days
- Progress % = Weighted average of milestone completion
- Gap = Timeline % - Progress %
- Status: Green if gap < 10%, Yellow if 10-25%, Red if > 25%

**Stagnation Detection**
- Active milestone = (Status = "In Progress") OR (Status = "Not Started" AND current date > planned start date)
- Stagnant = Active milestone AND last check-in > 48 hours ago
- Not flagged = Future milestones (planned start date not reached)

**Estimation Variance**
- Milestone variance = (Actual duration - Estimated duration) / Estimated duration * 100%
- Task variance = (Actual hours - Estimated hours) / Estimated hours * 100%
- Color: Green ‚â§50%, Yellow 50-200%, Red >200%

**Red Flag Logic**
- Critical üî¥: Over budget, missed deadline, no activity >48h on active milestone, budget >90% with >15% timeline remaining
- Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è: Falling behind, new tasks added, active milestone stagnant 24-48h, poor estimation >200%, repeated blocker 3+ times, delay not logged
