## 🚧 PENDING FEATURES

### 📁 Current Work Items
✅ **COMPLETED**: All current work items have been finished
- ✅ AI import component integration testing - Fully integrated and working
- ✅ Firebase Functions deployment (AI analysis endpoint) - Deployed successfully
- ✅ OpenAI API key configuration - Configured and functional
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility testing - Using modern React/Vite stack with good browser support
- ✅ Complete Integration Testing - End-to-end AI import workflow working
- ✅ Performance Testing - Large file processing validated with comprehensive test suite

### 🎯 Immediate Next (Week 1-2) - PRIORITY
1. **Cost Analysis Dashboard** - Real-time cost tracking and visualization
2. **Vendor Comparison Tools** - Side-by-side quote comparisons  
3. **Export Capabilities** - PDF reports, Excel exports, purchase orders
4. **Approval Workflows** - Multi-stage BOM approval process

### 👥 User Management System Status
🔧 **NEEDS TESTING**: User management system implemented but requires proper testing
- ✅ User Permission System - Admin vs regular user roles implemented
- ✅ User Approval Workflow - Admin approval system implemented
- 🧪 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - **NEEDS PROPER TESTING** - Firebase Custom Claims implemented but not fully tested
- ✅ Admin Dashboard - User management functions implemented
- 🧪 Permission Matrix - **NEEDS TESTING** - Project-level and feature-level restrictions need validation

## 🔮 PLANNED FEATURES

### 👥 Advanced User Management
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Admin users: Full system access, user management, settings configuration
  - Regular users: Limited access to projects and BOM operations
  - View-only users: Read-only access for stakeholders
- **User Registration Approval**
  - New user requests go to admin approval queue
  - Email notifications for pending approvals
  - Admin dashboard for user management
- **Permission Matrix**
  - Project-level permissions (owner, editor, viewer)
  - Feature-level restrictions (import, export, delete)
  - Settings access control (only admins can modify)

### 📊 Analytics & Reporting
- Project cost trends and budget tracking
- Vendor performance metrics
- Profit/Loss analysis enhancements
- User activity and audit logs

### 🤖 Intelligent Part Automation (n8n Integration)
- **Automatic Spec Sheet Scraping** - When BOM parts are added, trigger n8n workflows to find and download spec sheets from the internet
- **Backend Trigger System** - Firebase Functions will call n8n workflows for automated data enrichment
- **Part Data Enhancement** - Automatically populate part specifications, dimensions, electrical characteristics
- **Image Scraping** - Find and store product images for visual BOM identification
- **Price Monitoring** - Automated price tracking from supplier websites
- **Availability Checking** - Real-time stock status from vendor APIs via n8n flows

#### n8n Workflow Architecture
- **BOM Part Added Trigger** → Firebase Function → n8n HTTP Request
- **Web Scraping Workflows** → Part number search across manufacturer websites
- **Data Validation** → AI verification of scraped data accuracy
- **Storage Integration** → Automatic file storage in Firebase Storage
- **Update Notifications** → Real-time updates to frontend when data is enriched

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Bundle optimization for faster loading
- Enhanced data validation and security
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Mobile responsiveness enhancements

## 🛠️ DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### Code Standards
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Use shadcn-ui components consistently
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for async operations

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests for Firebase operations
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Performance testing for large data operations

### Deployment Process
1. Test locally with Firebase emulators
2. Deploy Firebase Functions for backend services
3. Test n8n workflow integrations
4. Deploy to production via Lovable platform
